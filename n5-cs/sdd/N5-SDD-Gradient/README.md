## Testing

1. Pick values that you can calculate the answers to.
2. Calculate the answers.
3. Use the values in the program.
4. Check the answers the computer gives.
5. If the same, use another set of values, otherwise work out what is wrong.


## Readability

Ensure that your program is easy to understand.  Use:

1. Meaningful identifiers (variable names)
2. Internal commentary (comments)
3. Whitespace (blank lines)
