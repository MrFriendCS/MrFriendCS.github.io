# N5 SDD - Dice


## Introduction

Dice games have been played since before recorded history.
Using a computer instead of physical dice is just moving with the times. 


## Task

Create a program that will simulate a single dice being thrown, and then ask a player to guess its value.
A message will thn be displayed depending if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
The value the computer threw will then be shown, so there's no cheating!
