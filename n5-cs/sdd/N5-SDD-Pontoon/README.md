# N5 SDD - Pontoon


## Introduction

Pontoon is a popular card game, which is also known as Spanish 21 and Blackjack. Itâ€™s usually played with between two and eight players.

Pontoon uses standard decks of 52 playing cards and the aim is to beat the dealer by having a hand closer to 21 than the dealer without going bust.  A total of more than 21 is bust.


## Task

Using the pseudocode below, implement code to create a simple game of Pontoon to allow a single player to practise.


### Top level design (Pseudocode)

```
Initialise card value
Initialise total score
initialise twist answer

Loop 2 times
    Pick a random card value from 2 to 11
    Display card value
    Add card value to total score
End loop

Get stick or twist from user

Start conditional loop for twist and total < 21

    Pick a random card value from 2 to 11
    
    If card value is 11 and total score > 10
        Set card value to 1
    End if

    Display card value

    Add card value to total score

    If total score <= 21
        Get stick or twist from user
    Else
        Display "Bust!"
    End if

End conditional loop

Display total score
```
