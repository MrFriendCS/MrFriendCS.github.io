# N5 SDD - Sport Results


## Introduction

The Barra Broadcationg Company (BBC) wants to upgrade how the sport results are produced.
Currently, the results are produced by hand but some of the handwriting is difficult to read which has led to some embarrassing mistakes!


## Task

Create a program that will ask for the names of two sports teams, their respective scores, and display a message depending on the scores.

A structure diagram of the design is provided below.
