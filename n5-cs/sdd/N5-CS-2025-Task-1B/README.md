# N5 CS 2024 - Task 1 Part B


## Introduction

Shake-Shake creates fruit-based drinks.
They need a computer program that will tell their customers if selected fruits would make a better milkshake, smoothie or fruit juice.  


## Program description

Shake-Shake wants a computer program that allows users to enter the names of up to 6 fruits.

The user enters the name of each fruit they want in their drink.
The program will validate each fruit name by checking it is at least 4 characters long.

The program then adds a mystery fruit, which it randomly selects from these options:

- apple
- banana
- blueberry
- kiwi
- mango
- orange
- peach
- pineapple
- raspberry
- strawberry

Once the user enters all their fruit options, the program adds the mystery fruit and uses the total number of fruits to determine whether it recommends a milkshake, smoothie or fruit juice.

Shake-Shake recommends that less than 3 fruits should be a milkshake, 3 or 4 fruits should be a smoothie, and more than 4 fruits should be a fruit juice.

The program will output a summary of the userâ€™s fruit choice, including the mystery fruit, and a message advising what type of drink to make.
