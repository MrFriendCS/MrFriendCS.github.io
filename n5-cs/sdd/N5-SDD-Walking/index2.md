# N5 SDD - Walking Distance Calculator Part 2


## Introduction

Walking is a popular hobby / exercise for many people.  There are different apps, both paid and free, that will record what someone has done.  
Often, the data is then shared in a way that the user is unaware of.


## Task

Create a small program for those who do not want to share their data.
It will ask the user how many weeks of data they have, and then allow them to enter a distance for each of the weeks.
It display the total distance and the mean distance, to 1 decimal place.


## Example User Interface

``` python
