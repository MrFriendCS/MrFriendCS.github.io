# N5 SDD - Walking Distance Calculator


## Introduction

Walking is a popular hobby / exercise for many people.  There are different apps, both paid and free, that will record what someone has done.  Often, the data is then shared in a way that the user is unaware of.


## Task

Create a small program for those who do not want to share their data.  It will calculate the total distance and the mean distance walked, over a four week period.  All results are to be rounded to 1 decimal place.


## Example User Interface

``` python

Week 3 distance? 9
Week 4 distance? 11.5

Average: 10.0 units per Week
