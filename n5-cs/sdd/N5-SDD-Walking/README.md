# N5 SDD - Walking Distance Calculator


## Introduction

Walking is a popular hobby / exercise for many people.  There are different apps, both paid and free, that will record what someone has done.  Often, the data is then used in a way that the user is unaware of.


## Task

## Example User Interface

``` python
