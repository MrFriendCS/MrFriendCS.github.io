# N5 SDD - Number Madness Part 2

## Task

Write a short program that will ask the user for two values.  The program will then show the results of the numbers being:

1. Added
2. Subtracted
3. Multiplied
4. Divided (rounded to 2 decimal places)
5. Squared and subtracted


### Example User Interface

```
Number Madness!
---------------

What is the first value? 10
What is the second value? 2

10 plus 2 is 12
10 minus 2 is 8

10 multiplied by 2 is 20
10 divided by 2 is 5.0

The square of 10 minus the square of 2 is 96
```

## Assumptions

The values entered by the user will be integers.


## Testing

1. Pick values that you can calculate the answers to.
2. Calculate the answers.
3. Use the values in the program.
4. Check the answers the computer gives.
5. If the same, use another set of values, otherwise work out what is wrong.


## Readability

Ensure that your program is easy to understand.  Use:

- Meaningful identifiers (variable names)
- Internal commentary (comments)
- Whitespace (blank lines)


## Reminders

- Everything from the keyboard is a string.
- Division creates a real value.
- Only strings can be concatenated.
