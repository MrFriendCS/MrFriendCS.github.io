# N5 SDD - Number Madness

## Task

Write a short program that will use two numbers.  The program will then show the results of the numbers being:

1. Added
2. Subtracted
3. Multiplied
4. Divided


### Example User Interface

```
Number Madness!
---------------

First value: 10
Second value: 2

2 added to 10 is 12
2 subtracted from 10 is 8

10 multiplied by 2 is 20
10 divided by 2 is 5.0
```


## Testing

1. Pick values that you can calculate the answers to.
2. Calculate the answers.
3. Use the values in the program.
4. Check the answers the computer gives.
5. If the same, use another set of values, otherwise work out what is wrong.


## Readability

Ensure that your program is easy to understand.

1. Meaningful identifiers (variable names)
2. Internal commentary (comments)
3. Whitespace (blank lines)


## Top Tips

1. Division creates a real value.
2. Only strings can be concatenated.
