# N5 SDD - Times Tables

## Task

Create a small program that will ask the user which times table they would like to see.
Display the requersted times table.


### Example User Interface

``` python
Times Table Generator
---------------------

Which times table? 3

Times table:

  1 x 3 = 3
  2 x 3 = 6
  3 x 3 = 9
  4 x 3 = 12
  5 x 3 = 15
  6 x 3 = 18
  7 x 3 = 21
  8 x 3 = 24
  9 x 3 = 27
  10 x 3 = 30

=====================
```


## Tips

Look at the expected interface.  Identify:

- Output that is fixed, i.e. text that does not change
- User input, and the appropriate data type
- Output that changes.  Does it:
    - Change as the user input changes
    - Change as part of a sequence


## Testing

1. Pick input values that you can calculate the answers to.
2. Calculate the answers.
3. Use the input values in the program.
4. Check the answers the computer gives.
5. If the your answers and the computer's answers are the same, use another set of values, otherwise work out what is wrong.


## Readability

Ensure that your program is easy to understand.  Use:

1. Meaningful identifiers (variable names)
2. Internal commentary (comments)
3. Whitespace (blank lines)
