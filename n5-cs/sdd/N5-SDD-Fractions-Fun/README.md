# N5 SDD - Fractions Fun

## Task

Write a short program that will add two fractions together.  There is no need to simplify the result.

Ensure equivalent fractions are shown.

*Tip:* Just use smile and a kiss


### Example User Interface

```
Fractions Fun!
--------------

2   3   14   15   29
- + - = -- + -- = --
5   7   35   35   35
```

*Note* Depending on the fractions used, the results might not line up nicely.  This is not an issue.


## Testing

1. Pick values that you can calculate the answers to.
2. Calculate the answers.
3. Use the values in the program.
4. Check the answers the computer gives.
5. If the same, use another set of values, otherwise work out what is wrong.


## Readability

Ensure that your program is easy to understand.  Use:

1. Meaningful identifiers (variable names)
2. Internal commentary (comments)
3. Whitespace (blank lines)
