# N5 SDD - Task Picker


## Introduction

Very few people enjoy doing chores.  There are different ways of organising them: a rota, leave them until someone buckles, lucky dip, ...


## Task

Using the flowchart below, implement a program that will ask how many tasks need doing and pick a name and a task for each of them.

The names and the tasks are your choice, but there must be at least:

* 4 different names
* 6 different tasks
