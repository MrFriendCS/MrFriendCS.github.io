# Higher Computing Science

## Software Design and Development

All the code examples use Python.  Python uses indentation (spaces at the beginning of a line) to show where code blocks are.

**Note:** These notes are focused on Higher Computing Science so some terms are used differently.  Any reference to an `array` will actually use a `list`.

## Implementation (data types and structures) 

Describe, exemplify and implement appropriately the following structures:
parallel 1D arrays
records
arrays of records

## Implementation (computational constructs)

Describe, exemplify and implement the appropriate constructs in a procedural high-level (textual) language:
parameter passing (formal and actual)
the scope of local and global variables
sub-programs/routines, defined by their name and arguments
(inputs and outputs):
— functions
— procedures
pre-defined functions (with parameters):
— to create substrings
— to convert from character to ASCII and vice versa
— to convert floating-point numbers to integers
— modulus
file handling:
— sequential CSV and txt files (open, create, read, write, close)

## Implementation (algorithm specification)

Describe, exemplify and implement standard algorithms using 1D arrays or arrays of records:
linear search
find minimum and maximum
count occurrences
