# N5 WDD - Group Choice

As a group, create a website by adding:

* Pages
* Links
* Images
* CSS

Each page is to include at least one image.

There are to be links between the pages, and include a link on each page to an external website.

All elements are to be formatted.  All CSS is to be in an external file.

All pages, except `index.html` are to be in a folder, to help keep the website tidy.

All images are to be in another folder, to help keep the wwebsite tidy.

## Validators

Use both the HTML and CSS validators to check that each webpage is correct.

* HTML: [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/)
* CSS: [jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

__N.B.__ If the CSS is correct on one page, it will be correct on all pages!
