# N5 SDD - Gross Cost

## Introduction

Food businesses often operate with a gross profit of 75%.  This sounds like a lot but after expenses (wages, energy, etc.) the net profit is much less.  The net is the orginal cost of an item, and the gross is the net multiplied by four.

A new food business wants to make sure it is charging enough to be able to stay in business.  Its unique selling point (USP) is that each plate of food only has three, four, or five ingredients.  Every ingredient costs less than £10.

## Task

Produce a program that will help the business calculate the price of each plate of food.

The user is to be asked how many ingredients there are, and the price of each ingredient.  The net cost of a plate will be calculated and displayed.

The gross price of each item will be displayed, and the gross cost of a plate will be caluclated and displayed.

Ensure all values are valid.
