# N5 SDD - Food Cost

## Introduction

Food businesses need to operate at a profit to stay in business.  This means they sell food for more than they buy it for.

A new food business wants to make sure it is charging enough to be able to stay in business.  Its unique selling point (USP) is that each plate of food only has three, four, or five ingredients.  Every ingredient costs less than £10 to the business.  It multiplies the cost of each item by four to see how much it should charge customers.

## Task

Produce a program that will help the business calculate the price of each plate of food.

The user is to be asked how many ingredients there are, and the price of each ingredient.  The cost of a plate will be calculated and displayed.

The price that each item will be sold for will be displayed, and the cost of a plate will be calculated and displayed.

Any example of the expected user interface is shown below.
