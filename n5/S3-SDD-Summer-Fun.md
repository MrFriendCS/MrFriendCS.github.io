# S3 SDD Tasks - Summer 2024

## Introduction

There are over seven weeks between classes in June and August.  There are four tasks below, about one every other week, to complete over the break.

Replit will switch off the Education element at the end of July, so make sure your code is still accessible when this happens.  An option would be to use [Thonny ](https://thonny.org/) or the [RPF Code Editor](https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/) and save your code to OneDrive or OneNote.

## Task 1

Ask the user to enter two values.  Use the values to do a number of calculations.

### Example

#### Input

```
Enter first value: 3
Enter second value: 2
```

#### Output

```
3 add 2 = 5
3 minus 2 = 1
3 times 2 = 6
3 divided by 2 = 1.5
3 to the power of 2 = 9
```

## Task 2

Ask the use for the base and height of a triangle.  Use these values to calculate the area.

### Example

#### Input

```
Enter the base: 10
Enter the height: 5
```

#### Output

```
Area: 25 units squared
```

## Task 3

Ask the user for a value.  Use the value to calculate its square root.

`Note:` Raise a value to the power of `0.5` to find it's square root.

### Example

#### Input

```
Enter a value: 25
```

#### Output

```
The square root of 25 is 5.0
```

## Task 4

Ask the user their name, year of birth (4 digits), and the current year (4 digits).  Use the information provided to calculate the years that some milestone ages are reached.

### Example

#### Input
```
Enter your name: Bob
Enter your birth year (4 digits): 2000
Enter the current year (4 digits): 2024
```

#### Output
```
Hi Bob, you are 24 this year.

Here are some significant birthdays:
16 - 2016
18 - 2018
21 - 2021
40 - 2040
60 - 2060
68 - 2068

If you retire at 68, you have 44 years to go.
```
