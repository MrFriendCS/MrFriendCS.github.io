# N5 SDD - Checkout

## Introduction

The Kisimul Buth wants a new checkout system.  Customers can buy one or more items at a time.  To speed the process up the cost of items are to be entered one after another, with a cost of `0` being used to finish.


## Tasks

1. Using a design technique of your choice, create an algorithm for the solution.

2. Create a comprehensive test plan.

3. Implement a program that matches the design.

4. Use the test plan to check that the program works correctly.

An example user interface has been designed.  Ensure that Kisimul Buth can not lose money.


### Assumptions
