# H SDD - Create a Task


## Task

Create a task that can be given to other pupils who have covered the SDD implementation part of the H CS course.

The task, and solution, must be in line with the [H CS specification](https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/h-course-spec-computing-science.pdf)

The task should have three parts:

1. Back story, covering the purpose and any assumptions

2. Top level design, either Structure diagram or Pseudocode, with appropriate refinements

3. Solution

Make sure all the parts 'hang together'.
