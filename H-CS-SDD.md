# Higher Computing Science

## Software Design and Development

All the code examples use Python.  Python uses indentation (spaces at the beginning of a line) to show where code blocks are.

**Note:** These notes are focused on Higher Computing Science so some terms are used differently.  Any reference to an `array` will actually use a `list`.

### Data

The data used in the examples will be:

| Name | Age | Height |
|--|--|--|
| Alan | 22 | 1.78 |
| Beth | 23 | 1.63 |
| Carl | 24 | 1.89 |
| Dina | 21 | 1.59 |

Which can also be represented as a comma separated values (`data.csv`):

```
Alan,22,1.78
Beth,23,1.63
Carl,24,1.89
Dina,21,1.59
```

## Implementation (data types and structures) 

### parallel 1D arrays

Parallel arrays have the same number of elements in each array.

``` python
names = ["Alan", "Beth", "Carl", "Dina"]
ages = [22, 23, 24, 21]
heights = [1.78, 1.63. 1.89, 1.59]
```

### records


### arrays of records


## Implementation (computational constructs)

Describe, exemplify and implement the appropriate constructs in a procedural high-level (textual) language:

parameter passing (formal and actual)

the scope of local and global variables

sub-programs/routines, defined by their name and arguments (inputs and outputs):
— functions
— procedures

pre-defined functions (with parameters):
— to create substrings
— to convert from character to ASCII and vice versa
— to convert floating-point numbers to integers
— modulus

file handling:
— sequential CSV and txt files (open, create, read, write, close)

## Implementation (algorithm specification)

Describe, exemplify and implement standard algorithms using 1D arrays or arrays of records:

linear search

find minimum and maximum

count occurrences
