# N5 Computing Science

## Software Design and Development

All code examples use Python.

**Note:** These notes are focused on N5 Computing Science so some terms are used differently.  Any reference to an `array` will actually use a `list`.

### Implementation (computational constructs)

#### expressions to assign values

Variables are used to store values.

``` python
myInteger = 5
```

``` python
myFloat = 3.14
```

``` python
myCharacter = "&"
```

``` python
myString = "Hello"
```

``` python
myBoolean = True
```

``` python
myArrayOfIntegers = [56, 34, 2, 85, 51]
```




#### expressions to return values using arithmetic operations

Addition
``` python
4 + 2
```

Subtraction
``` python
4 - 2
```

Multiplication
``` python
4 * 2
```

Division
``` python
4 / 2
```

Exponentiation (to the power of)
``` python
4 ** 2
```

Examples
``` python
myMultiplication = 3 * 2

mySquare = 3 ** 2

myCounter = 0
myCounter = myCounter + 1
```

#### expressions to concatenate strings

Concatenate means to join together.

``` python
part1 = "Ho"
part2 = "use"

word = part1 + part2
```

Be sure to include a space between words when concatenating.

``` python
word1 = "Hello"
word2 = "world"

phrase = word1 + " " + word2
```

#### selection constructs using simple conditional statement

##### Comparisons

Compare one value with another to produce an answer of either `True` or `False`.

Equality (the same as)
``` python
16 == 18
```

Inequality (not the same as)
``` python
16 != 18
```


``` python
age = 16

if 
word2 = "world"

phrase = word1 + " " + word2
```

#### selection constructs using complex conditional statements


#### logical operators




#### iteration and repetition using fixed and conditional loops


#### predefined functions

##### random


##### round


##### length


### Implementation (algorithm specification)

#### input validation



#### running total within loop



#### traversing a 1-D array
