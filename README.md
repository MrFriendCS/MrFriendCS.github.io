# N5 Computing Science

## Software Design and Development

**Note:** These notes are focused on N5 Computing Science so some Python terms are used differently.  Any reference to an `array` will actually use a `list`.

### Implementation (computational constructs)

#### expressions to assign values

Variables are used to store values.

``` python
myInteger = 5
```

``` python
myFloat = 3.14
```

``` python
myCharacter = "&"
```

``` python
myString = "Hello"
```

``` python
myBoolean = True
```

``` python
myArrayOfIntegers = [56, 34, 2, 85, 51]
```




#### expressions to return values using arithmetic operations

#### expressions to concatenate strings


#### selection constructs using complex conditional statements


#### logical operators


#### selection constructs using simple conditional statements

#### iteration and repetition using fixed and conditional loops


#### predefined functions

##### random


##### round


##### length


### Implementation (algorithm specification)

#### input validation



#### running total within loop



#### traversing a 1-D array
