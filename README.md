## Software Design and Development

All code examples use Python.

**Note:** These notes are focused on N5 Computing Science so some terms are used differently.  Any reference to an `array` will actually use a `list`.

### Implementation (computational constructs)

#### expressions to assign values

Variables are used to store values.  An assignment statement has 3 parts:

 1. An assignment operator $=$ (an equals sign in maths)
 2. The value to the right of the assignment operator
 3. The variable name to the left of the assignment operator

The value is assigned to the variable.  The value *might* need to be calculated first before being assigned.

``` python
myInteger = 5
```

``` python
myFloat = 3.14
```

``` python
myCharacter = "&"
```

``` python
myString = "Hello"
```

``` python
myBoolean = True
```

``` python
myArrayOfIntegers = [56, 34, 2, 85, 51]
```




#### expressions to return values using arithmetic operations

Addition
``` python
4 + 2
```

Subtraction
``` python
4 - 2
```

Multiplication
``` python
4 * 2
```

Division
``` python
4 / 2
```

Exponentiation (to the power of)
``` python
4 ** 2
```

Examples
``` python
myMultiplication = 3 * 2

mySquare = 3 ** 2

myCounter = 0
myCounter = myCounter + 1
```

#### expressions to concatenate strings

Concatenate means to join together.

``` python
part1 = "Ho"
part2 = "use"

word = part1 + part2
```

Be sure to include a space between words when concatenating.

``` python
word1 = "Hello"
word2 = "world"

phrase = word1 + " " + word2
```

#### selection constructs using simple conditional statement

##### Comparisons

Compare one value with another to produce a Boolean answer of either `True` or `False`.

Equality (the same as)
``` python
16 == 18
```

Inequality (not the same as)
``` python
16 != 18
```

Greater than
``` python
16 > 18
```

Greater than or equal to
``` python
16 >= 18
```

Less than
``` python
16 < 18
```

Less than or equal to
``` python
16 <= 18
```

``` python
age = 16

if 
word2 = "world"

phrase = word1 + " " + word2
```

#### selection constructs using complex conditional statements


#### logical operators




#### iteration and repetition using fixed and conditional loops


#### predefined functions

##### random


##### round


##### length


### Implementation (algorithm specification)

#### input validation



#### running total within loop



#### traversing a 1-D array
