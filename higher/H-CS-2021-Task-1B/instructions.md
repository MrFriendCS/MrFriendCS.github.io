# H CS 2021 Task 1 Part B

### Software design and development

Thirty athletes have qualified for the final of the Scottish Jumping Jacks competition. Qualifying events were held at four locations, where each athlete performed as many jumping jacks as they could in 1 minute.

The following details are stored in a CSV file, for each athlete who qualified for the final:

* Entry ID
* Qualifying location
* Forename
* Surname
* Number of jumping jacks completed

## Purpose

A program is required to read each of the athlete’s data from the existing CSV file. A bib value for each of the finalists will be generated and stored in a new CSV file along with the entry ID. The program will also display the full name of the athlete(s) who completed the highest number of jumping jacks.

An example of the bib value generated for the athlete Daniel Currie, who qualified at the 
Inverness event, is shown below. Note that 73 is the ASCII value of ‘I’, the first character 
of Inverness.

```
DCurrie73
```

## Assumptions

* The CSV file has data for 30 athletes, is formatted correctly and is error-free. 
* Each line of the CSV file stores the entry ID, qualifying location, forename, surname and number of jumping jacks completed at qualification, as shown below:
 
```
f01,Motherwell,Ellie,McAninch,85
f02,Inverness,Ayat,Whyte,83
f03,Kirkcaldy,Simra,Zamora,42
f04,Motherwell,Dai,Nguyen,37
f05,Coatbridge,Max,Hughes,113
...
```

## Program top-level design (pseudocode)

| Step | Data Flow |
| :--- | :-------- |
| 1. Get qualifying athletes’ data | OUT: entryID(), location(), forename(), surname(), jumps() |
| 2. Generate bib values and write to new file with entry IDs | IN: entryID(), location(), forename(), surname() |
| 3. Find the highest number of jumping jacks completed | IN: jumps()<br> OUT: maxJumps |
| 4. Display the full name of the athlete(s) who completed the highest number of jumping jacks | IN: maxJumps,forename(), surname(), jumps() |

### Refinements

```
1.1 Open athletes.csv file
1.2 Loop for thirty athletes
1.3   Store entryID, location, forename, surname, jumps for athlete in parallel arrays
1.4 End loop
1.5 Close athletes.csv file

2.1 Create bibValues.csv file
2.2 Loop for thirty athletes
2.3   Set bibValue to first letter of forename & full surname & ASCII value of first letter of location
2.4   Write entryID and bibValue to file
2.5 End loop
2.6 Close bibValues.csv file

3.1 Set maximum jumps to the value stored in the first index of the jumps array
3.2 Start loop from second index to end of array
3.3   If the current number of jumps is more than maximum jumps then
3.4     Set maximum jumps to current number of jumps
3.5   End if
3.6 End loop
3.7 Return maximum jumps

4.1 Loop for thirty athletes
4.2   If current number of jumps equals maximum jumps then
4.3      Display forename and surname
4.4   End if
4.5 End loop
```

___1c(i)___ Using the problem description and design, implement the program in a language of your choice. Your program should:

* be maintainable and modular
* use a function to find and return the maximum number of jumps
* follow the design and the refinements provided

(__13 marks__) 

Print evidence of:

* your completed program code
* your output, showing athlete(s) with the maximum number of jumps
* your CSV file containing the entry ID and bib values

_Include your name and candidate number on all evidence._

___1c(ii)___ The location with the fewest number of athletes qualifying will host the next final.

A new sub-program is to be implemented to find the total number of athletes from each location in the final. An example of the output is shown below.

```
Coatbridge has 6 finalists
Inverness has 8 finalists
Kirkcaldy has 7 finalists
Motherwell has 9 finalists
```

Implement the additional sub-program.

(__2 marks__)

Print evidence of:

* your edited program code
* the display produced by the new sub-program

_Include your name and candidate number on all evidence._

___1d___ The function to find the maximum number of jumps is tested using the following test data.

jumps = [100,87,102,108,95]

A watchpoint is placed on the variable storing the maximum number of jumps.

Complete the table below by entering:

* the lines of code from your program where the watchpoint is triggered
* the value of the maximum number of jumps variable when the watchpoint is triggered

| Line of code from your program | Value of the maximum number of jumps |
| --- | --- |
|     |     |

(__3 marks__)

___1e___ With reference to your own program code, evaluate:


* the fitness for purpose of the function to generate bib values

* the maintainability of your program, referring to modularity
