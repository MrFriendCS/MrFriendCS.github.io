# H SDD - Substrings

## Task

Using modular programming, create a program that asks the user for a word or phrase, and then asks for the following integer values:

1. Left count
2. Right count
3. Mid start number
4. Mid count

The program will then extract and display substrings using the word or phrase and the values entered.

## Example

```
Enter a word or phrase: Hello

Left characters: 4
Right charcters: 2
Mid start character: 3
Mid count charcters: 2

Left: Hell
Right: lo
Mid: ll
```

## Requirements

Create, as a minimum, three named subprograms that will accept the parameters shown and return the required substrings:

``` Python
left(text, number)

right(text, number)

mid(text, start, number)
```

## Tests

To run the tests delete everything after the functions.  __Use Ctrl + Z to undo.__
