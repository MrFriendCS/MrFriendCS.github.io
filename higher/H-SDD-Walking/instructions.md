# H SDD - Walking

## Task

A small app is required to record how far someone has walked over a four week period.  The app will ask the user to enter a valid total distance for each of the four weeks.  An example of the user interface is shown below.

### Example: User Interface

```
Enter the distance walked each week:

Week 1: 12.3
Week 2: 9.7
Week 3: 11.1
Week 4: 12.7
```

The app will calculate the total distance, and the average distance to 1 decimal point.

The data and the results will be written to a file `walking.txt`.  An example of the file content is shown below.

### Example: walking.txt

```
