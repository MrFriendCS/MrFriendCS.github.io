# H SDD - Tuck Shop Prices

## Introduction

The Youth Cafe runs a tuck shop that sells sweets, crisps, drinks etc. The details of how much each item costs to buy from the Co-op is kept in the file [tuckshop.txt](assets/tuckshop.txt "Text file").

The Youth Cafe sells the items at a small profit (10%).  A price list is created that shows the details of the items and the price they are sold for.  These details are saved in held in a file called `pricelist.txt`.

The file [tuckshop.txt](assets/tuckshop.txt "Text file") contains the information about seven sweets that are sold in the Youth Cafe tuck shop.  There are three fields in the file: Name, Weight, and Price.

## Task

Increase the prices by 10%, update the names of the items so each starts with a capital letter, and then save the data in a new file called `pricelist.txt`.  The information is to be written so the file can be printed and used in the tuck shop.

## Program top-level design (pseudocode)

```
1. Read data from `tuckshop.txt`
2. Increase prices by 10%
3. Update item names - start with capital letters
4. Write data to `pricelist.txt`
```

## Refinements

```
4.1   If price less than a pound
4.1.1     write as pence
4.1.2 Otherwise
4.1.3     write as pounds
4.1.4 End if
```
