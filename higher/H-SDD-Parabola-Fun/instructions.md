# Parabola Fun

## Tasks

### Task 1

Create a procedure to calculate  the value of the discriminant and the type of roots for a parabola when passed the coefficients of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

A skeleton procedure has been provided.

### Task 2

Create a procedure to calculate the roots of a parabola when passed the coefficients of `a`, `b`, and `c`, rounded to 1 decimal place.

__Assumption__: Only coefficients for parabolas that have real roots will be passed to the procedure.

## Example Output

### Example: Task 1

```
a = 1   b = 2   c = 4
Discriminant: -12
No real roots

a = 4   b = 7   c = 3
Discriminant: 1
Two real and distinct roots

a = 1   b = 6   c = 9
Discriminant: 0
Two real and equal roots
```

### Example: Task 2

```
a = 1   b = 2   c = -24
x = 4.0
x = -6.0

a = -1  b = -3  c = 54
x = -9.0
x = 6.0
```

* `\n` = newline
* `\t` = tab
* `x**0.5` = square root
